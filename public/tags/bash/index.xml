      <description>So here&amp;rsquo;s the problem statement: _Find the repository on github in which you have made most number of commits? And you need to do this on terminal (no python)__
Ofcourse, one can use python to find the answer, and it might be probably easy for you, if you have been using python for last many years. But let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can do this in terminal with jq and while doing so, let&amp;rsquo;s learn about it.</description>

      <description>Manager: Hey, I need your help, I have couple of images that are taking a lot of space on my PC, I want to delete them. How can I do that?
Developer: Well that should be simple. Here, you go. This looks for all files with .png extension in the current directory and its subdirectories (using -R flag), then pipes those file names to rm command to delete them.
ls -R | grep &amp;#34;.</description>
